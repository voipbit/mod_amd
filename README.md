mod_amd for FreeSWITCH
===============================

This is an implementation of answering machine detection (voice
activity detection) for FreeSWITCH.

Currently, in limited testing, we are able to get satisfactory results in
determining what is a human and what is a machine. This has been tested with millions of machines across globe.

Building
--------

To build this module, all you need to do is type `make`, but because it relies
on `pkg-config` and FreeSWITCH, you need to point `pkg-config` to where
FreeSWITCH is installed before building:

```
host$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/freeswitch/lib/pkgconfig/
host$ make
```

Sample Configuration
--------------------
Just put a file like this in your freeswitch installation, in **conf/autoload_configs/amd.conf.xml**
```xml
<configuration name="mod_amd.conf" description="mod_amd Configuration">
  <settings>
    <param name="silence_threshold" value="256"/>
    <param name="maximum_word_length" value="5000"/>
    <param name="maximum_number_of_words" value="3"/>
    <param name="between_words_silence" value="50"/>
    <param name="min_word_length" value="100"/>
    <param name="total_analysis_time" value="5000"/>
    <param name="after_greeting_silence" value="800"/>
    <param name="greeting" value="1500"/>
    <param name="initial_silence" value="2500"/>
  </settings>
</configuration>
```
